# When to use BFS and DFS

While this depends entirely on the question and requirements, here is a general guideline -

1. BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph since it explores all nodes at the current depth level before going deeper, guaranteeing the shortest path when it finds the target node.
2. BFS is often used when you need to process nodes level by level. When you need to explore all neighbors of a node before moving further, BFS is more suitable.
3. BFS can be used to find all nodes connected to a given node and is useful in determining whether a graph is connected or finding all connected components.

4. DFS is useful for finding any path between two nodes when a specific path (not necessarily the shortest) is required. It's helpful for problems like finding all possible paths between nodes. For example, find all paths between two cities in a road network.
5. For problems involving dependency resolution (like task scheduling or build order), DFS is useful as it can help detect cycles and generate a topological order in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). For example, determine a valid order in which to complete a list of tasks, given some tasks are prerequisites of others.
6. DFS is naturally suited for problems involving backtracking, where you need to explore all possible solutions and may need to abandon some paths as you go deeper. For example, solving a maze, n-queens problem, or generating combinations and permutations.
7. DFS is useful in finding Strongly connected components and cycle detection.
